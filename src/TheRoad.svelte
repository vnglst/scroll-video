      <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>

      <p>by ROBERT FROST</p>

    <div class="str str1">
      <p>
        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br /> And sorry I could not travel both<br />
        And be one traveler, long I stood<br /> And looked down one as far as I could<br />
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="str str2">
      <p>
        Then took the other, as just as fair,<br /> And having perhaps the better
        claim,<br /> Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br /> Though as for that
        the passing there<br /> Had worn them really about the same,
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="str str3">
      <p>
        And both that morning equally lay<br /> In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br /> Yet knowing how way leads on
        to way, <br /> I doubted if I should ever come back.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="str str4">
      <p>
        I shall be telling this with a sigh<br /> Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br /> I took the one less traveled by,<br />
        And that has made all the difference.
